So everything started in [Jerusalem](set/213867). I was 18. I had never been in Israel before. And I had never felt a special attraction for photography either. But I was truly enchanted by Jerusalem and the neighborhood of Mea Shearim, by this timeless choreography in this little enclave, this shtetl in the heart of the Middle East. In other terms, diaspora, in the heart of Jerusalem. 

Jacques Derrida, who wrote about this photograph, said that Mea Shearim is the key of diaspora. It remains outside of home at home. And Mea Shearim became the matrix of my entire project, which then led me to over 45 countries. And this is [my very first photograph, Purim in Jerusalem](item/227928).

In the next [photograph](item/228092), we could very well be in Poland or somewhere in Eastern Europe 100 years ago under a sukkah.

The next [photograph](item/96478), we are very far from Jerusalem. We are in Birobidzhan in the far east of the former Soviet Union, a 9 hours flight from Moscow, to give you an idea of where you are on the map, one hour from Tokyo. We are in the [Jewish autonomous region of the Soviet Union](set/92504), an idea of Stalin from the thirties, early thirties, where Jews from around the world, not only from Russia and other republics, but also from Argentina, France, America, came to settle and create a Jewish state 20 years before the creation of the state of Israel. Here in the middle of the taiga at the border of China, below 40 centigrade in winter plus 40 centigrade in summer. I think Jews have never been afraid of such experiments in Utopia. Doesn't such inclination in fact define who we are?

The next [photograph](item/114787), we are in Ilyinka, Russia, a collective farm, the place, in fact, where at that time Natan Sharansky was arrested while encouraging this community known under the name of “Subbotnik Gery’s” to immigrate to Israel. This family, like most others, emigrated to Israel a few years later and live today in Beit Shemesh. And I think I chose this photograph because it seems very out of a Dostoyevsky novel. We are not yet in the Soviet Union, but more that it’s under a tsarist regime. And if you look above the bed, you see a portrait of the grandfather, which looks more like an icon.

In the next [photograph](item/95556), we are in Bukhara, the night of Hoshana Rabbah, in the synagogue. And as you know, there's a tradition to study all night. So I went for the first time to the former [Soviet Union in 1982](set/92511), when the Perestroika didn't even start. I was one of the very first Western photographers to then negotiate and obtain permission to travel in the 14 republics out of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union. And I wanted to really show the incredibly ethnic and cultural diversity within this territory. While we had a very monolithic perception of what the Soviet Union was. And there were basically, in the former Soviet Union, four main distinct Jewish communities. Ashkenazim who lived, you know, between Russia, Belorussia, Ukraine. And then you had three other very important communities, the community of Jews who lived in Central Asia, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, called Bukharian Jews. Then you had Jews from Georgia, Gurjim. And then you have mountain Jews, Gorskie Yevrei. And what is amazing is that the three other communities apart from white Ashkenazim were able to retain their specific identity in republics where in fact Islam was prevailing. And the Jews just got the benefit of what the Muslim population was enjoying because of the fear of the central government regarding potential Muslim fundamentalism. And what is beautiful in this photograph is that you see there's hardly any books on the table. You have maybe four elders who still know how to read, but people are still present. It's past midnight and we are in the synagogue of Bukhara.

[In the next photograph](item/105775) we are in Leninabad, Tajikistan, not far from the Afghan border and we are in a Jewish hairdressers salon. All barbers are Jews, all customers are Muslim Tajiks. And when Mark Twain says Jews are just like everybody else, only more so. I think this is what this photograph is just about, and this is what the overall project is about. I mean, I photographed later on, I traced back 15 families in 1998 for the 50th anniversary of Israel and the photograph is like a diptych in Tajikistan or in Yemen and then in Israel. And I traced back all the barbers of all the customers are Muslim, Tajik. So they stayed there, but of the same photograph, all those barbers floating in the Dead Sea.

[In the next photograph](item/77615) we are in Ethiopia, more exactly in the Abyssinian mountains, close to Eritrea. And when I see this photograph, I say, Was I really there? It's you know, they look like living fossile, it’s so sculptural. And they are the contemporary of so many of the people that you have seen and that you will see in the coming photographs. I was interested to photograph this community just before they were airlifted to Israel, the first airlift. And because this is a community which had retained pre-Talmudic practices which have disappeared from the rest of the Jewish world.
